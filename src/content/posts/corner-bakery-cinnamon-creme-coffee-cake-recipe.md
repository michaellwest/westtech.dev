Corner Bakery Cinnamon Creme Coffee Cake  
Topping and Filling Ingredients:  
  
1/2 cup sugar  
2/3 cup brown sugar  
2 tsp. ground cinnamon (I would double this)  
1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg  
2 2/3 cups flour  
2 sticks salted butter, melted  
  
Cake Ingredients:  
  
3 cups flour  
2 tsp. baking powder  
1 tsp. baking soda  
1/4 tsp. salt  
1/2 cup butter, room temp, cut into pieces  
1/2 cup vegetable shortening  
1 1/2 cups sugar  
5 eggs  
1 1/2 tsp. almond extract (I substituted vanilla)  
2 cups sour cream  
  
Directions:  
  
Preheat oven to 350º. Grease and flour 10 inch/12 cup tube pan very well. (Do not use a smaller pan or a bundt pan.)  
  
Combine first five topping ingredients in a large bowl, add melted butter and combine with a wooden spoon. You want big chunks of the topping and filling so don’t over mix.  
  
Cake: Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium size bowl, set aside.  
  
In a large bowl cream butter, shortening, and sugar until very light. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Mix in almond extract. Add the dry cake ingredients alternating with the sour cream. The batter will be very thick.  
  
Spoon half of the cake batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle half of the topping mixture over the batter, then the remaining cake batter, then remaining topping. Press the final topping layer into the cake layer very gently, just to make sure it “sticks”.  
  
Bake in the center of the oven for 50 – 1 hour and 15 minutes. Cake is done when it starts to pull away from the sides and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pan for 30 minutes. Loosen sides of cake with knife and invert onto a wire rack and then invert again on to serving platter. Sprinkle with powder sugar to finish.  
  
(I made the following high altitude changes in the cake batter: 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 3/4 teaspoon baking soda, 1 1/4 cup sugar.)
