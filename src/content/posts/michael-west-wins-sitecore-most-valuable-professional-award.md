### Michael West Wins Sitecore "Most Valuable Professional" Award

> Elite distinction awarded for exceptional contributions to the Sitecore ecosystem

  
Dallas, TX, USA - January, 31, 2018 - Michael West has been named a "Most Valuable Professional (MVP)" in the Technology category by [Sitecore](https://www.sitecore.net/)®, the global leader in experience management software. Michael West was one of only 208 Technology MVPs worldwide to be named a Sitecore MVP this year.  
  
Now in its 12th year, Sitecore’s MVP program recognizes individual technology, strategy, and commerce advocates who share their Sitecore passion and expertise to offer positive customer experiences that drive business results. The Sitecore MVP Award recognizes the most active Sitecore experts from around the world who participate in online and offline communities to share their knowledge with other Sitecore partners and customers.  
  
"The Sitecore MVP awards recognize and honor those individuals who make substantial contributions to our loyal community of partners and customers,” said Pieter Brinkman, Sitecore Senior Director of Technical Marketing. “MVPs consistently set a standard of excellence by delivering technical chops, enthusiasm, and a commitment to giving back to the Sitecore community. They truly understand and deliver on the power of the Sitecore Experience Platform to create personalized brand experiences for their consumers, driving revenue and customer loyalty."  
  
The Sitecore Experience Platform™ combines web content management, omnichannel digital delivery, insights into customer activity and engagement, and strategic digital marketing tools into a single, unified platform.
